## Description
A blog written in React, the user can add and edit posts after logging in, as well as the account itself after clicking on the avatar. Each user, whether logged in or not, has the possibility to segregate posts on the main page by category. Similarly, when clicking on the author of a post, only the posts of this one user are displayed. As I have concentrated mainly on writing the server and integration with the front-end and adding images, there is no form validation or error handling, for example. 

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

**Client:** React, CSS Modules, React Context + useReducer, Firebase

**Server:** Node, Express,MongoDb, AWS S3, REST API, Heroku 

## Lessons Learned
When writing the blog, I mainly focused on implementing routing in React, using React Context with useReducer to handle the state of the application, and the ability to add images and handle this on the frontend as well as the server side. Also, just writing the server using Express.js and storing the data in MongoDb gave me practice so that i can now write a full-stack application.
